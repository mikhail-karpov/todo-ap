# OAuth2 with Keycloak and Spring Boot Applications

This is an example of using OAuth2, Spring Security, Keycloak, PostgreSQL and Docker.

## Prerequisites

To make things work, youâ€™ll need to make sure to add the following to your hosts file 
(/etc/hosts on Mac/Linux, c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts on Windows):

<code>127.0.0.1 keycloak</code>

This is because you will access your application with a browser on your machine 
(which name is localhost, or 127.0.0.1), but inside Docker it will run in its own containers.

# OAuth2 with Keycloak and Spring Boot Applications

This is an example of using OAuth2, Spring Security, Keycloak, PostgreSQL and Docker.

## How to run

To make things work, youâ€™ll need to make sure to add the following to your hosts file 
(/etc/hosts on Mac/Linux, c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts on Windows):

127.0.0.1 keycloak

This is because you will access your application with a browser on your machine 
(which name is localhost, or 127.0.0.1), but inside Docker it will run in its own container, 
which name is keycloak.

After restart, launch the application using Maven in Docker:

<code>mvn clean package [-DskipTests]</code>
</br>
<code>docker-compose up</code>
